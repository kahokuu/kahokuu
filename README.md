- 👋 Hi, I’m @kahokuu (:
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, design, and now web development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JS! I hope to also learn React and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any project for beginners! Seeing as I'm at a beginner level, I'd love to collaborate on anything that could give me more experience. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can message me here, or you can message me on discord @Kahoku.
